    question: "To: Home Owner<br>From: Taryn Kent<br>Subject: Your home<br>Sent: January 7<br><br>Hello. I've been looking at the photo gallery of your online home buyer's ad. Congratulations on trying to sell your home without a real estate agent. It is difficult (we have done it twice) but is worth the effort if you find a reasonable buyer. My sister is interested in buying a home in your region. Your home could be ideal if you are willing to negotiate the price. Your asking price is about $10, 000 above her budget. She also wants to live near an elementary school and a bus route. I'm not sure if your home is near these amenities. Could you let me know about these details? Most importantly, are you open to negotiation on the price? Please let me know when the house would be available for viewing.<br>Thank you.<br>Sincerely,<br>Taryn Kent",
    direct: "Respond to the email as if you are trying to sell your house privately. Answer the questions and provide at least TWO details about the neighbourhood and ONE reason why you can or can't negotiate the price.",
    answer: "To: Taryn Kent<br>From: Home Owner<br>Subject: My home<br>Sent: January 8<br><br>Hi. Thank you for your message. We are excited about selling our home privately. Your sister is welcome to call me at 222-444-4444 to schedule a time to see our home. We will be showing it this weekend. We are willing to negotiate but will not be able to drop the price too much. We have just spent $7000 on basement renovations.<br>There is an elementary school a few blocks from here. It has a very good reputation. The local bus stop is about a five minute walk down the hill. I look forward to meeting your sister. Thank you for reviewing the photos. We love this house and have lived here for twenty years.<br>Warm regards,<br>James Canyon"
